# FP Party To-Do

- cmd: FF
- cmd: MDTP
- New spawn system :v not soon...
- add scrn voting support
- make it so the spawnrate lowers when players die - not including fakes.
  make it change to the values in CalcNextSquadSpawnTime
- Add mdtp system so that any spawns directly above a player will be disabled. e.g. Biohazard 3 way spawn spot.
