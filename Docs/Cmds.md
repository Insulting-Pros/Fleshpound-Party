## General Info

If you have increased player slots and have too many zeds per player - edit `Post6ZedsPerPlayer` in config. Lower values means fewer zeds per player.

`bUseOriginalFakes=False`: "simulated" fakes wil be used and players will be able to join. If you have `SimulatedFakes=4` and play with 3 player team - wave zeds amount will be calculated for 4 players. If you play with 6 player team - for 6.
bUseOriginalFakes=True: works like in vanilla.
